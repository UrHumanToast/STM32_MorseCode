# LED Morse Code - STM32

This program is something is written in embedded C, where it can show the full picture.
With no need for extra electronics to show what it does, I figured I would post it. It's simple, but cool enough. It isn't as cool as USART, integrators, or differentiators, but it's sweet and simple.
